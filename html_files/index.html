            <h2>Lakshimi Japanese Tea</h2>
            <p>
                Lakshimi started with a tea class that the representative, Yoko Toda, started
                at home. In 2005, "Lakshimi Tea Shop" opened in Kitano, Kobe. <br>
                In 2008, we started to blend original tea. Initially, we made only a few blends, 
                but as we learned about the tastes and preferences of our customers, we gradually 
                increased the number of original blends. <br>
                In 2011, we developed our popular product, "Premium Honey Tea". This tea was well-received 
                by customers who enjoyed its sweet yet low-calorie content, makinng it a mainstay 
                in our store. <br>
                We continue our journey of discovering new blends and introducing the world to the 
                "Elegant Tea Style" from kobe. <br>
                As the goddess Lakshimi bestows wealth, love, justice, and bliss upon people, we too 
                strive to enrich people's lives with our teas.
