            <h2>Lakshimi Japanese Tea</h2>
            <p>
                Lakshimi started with a tea class that the representative, Yoko Toda, started
                at home. In 2005, "Lakshimi Tea Shop" opened in Kitano, Kobe. <br>
                In 2008, we started to blend original tea. Initially, we made only a few blends, 
                but as we learned about the tastes and preferences of our customers, we gradually 
                increased the number of original blends. <br>
                In 2011, we developed our popular product, "Premium Honey Tea". This tea was well-received 
                by customers who enjoyed its sweet yet low-calorie content, makinng it a mainstay 
                in our store. <br>
                We continue our journey of discovering new blends and introducing the world to the 
                "Elegant Tea Style" from kobe. <br>
                As the goddess Lakshimi bestows wealth, love, justice, and bliss upon people, we too 
                strive to enrich people's lives with our teas.

            <p>
                This tea is a very popular product that Lakshimi is proud of, and it was launched 
                in 2011 as Lakshimi's first tea bag. As a product delivered by a tea sommelier from 
                a tea specialty shop, we have maximized the flavor of the tea leaves. We blend powdered 
                multi-floral honey from Spain into the tea. The sweetness of the honey is so strong that 
                there is no need to use sugar. The fact that it's sweet and delicious but only 3kcal per 
                cup is also very popular. just one sip brings a feeling of happiness, a rich flavor. It's 
                a delicious tea, whether hot or iced, straight or as a milk tea.
